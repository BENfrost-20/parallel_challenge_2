If you wack your head at the problem instead, and solve it, the solution will stick in the back of your mind for a long time. Similarly, if despite pushing yourself you can't find \"that damn bug\", then asking an LLM is fine, so long as you tried first by yourself and just say \"ahhhhhh, so that what it was!\" upon having the LLM help you out.
